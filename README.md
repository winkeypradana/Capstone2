**Business Understanding**:
Context:
As a significant player in the digital hospitality industry, Airbnb faces unique challenges in managing and optimizing its listings. With a business model focused on accommodations provided by individuals and companies, Airbnb relies on data from listings to determine its business strategies and policies. This dataset, encompassing various aspects of listings in Bangkok, allows us to delve deeper into the market dynamics, consumer preferences, and factors influencing the success of a listing.

Problem Statement:
Amid intense market competition and the need to maintain service quality, Airbnb confronts challenges in maximizing revenue and ensuring customer satisfaction. A primary issue is how to set optimal pricing, enhance the popularity of listings, and understand the impact of location and other factors on listing performance. With this dataset, we can analyze the factors affecting listing performance and identify ways to improve hosts' success on the Airbnb platform.

Goals:
The main goal of this analysis is to provide insights that can help Airbnb and its hosts make more informed decisions regarding pricing, promotion, and listing management. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Identify the factors influencing the price and popularity of listings.
2. Determine the impact of location and other characteristics on listing performance.
3. Develop recommendations based on the analysis to improve revenue and customer satisfaction.

Stakeholders: The primary stakeholders of this analysis are the managers and executives at Airbnb responsible for operational strategy and the hosts who use the Airbnb platform to rent out their properties.

Analytic Approach:
The first step in this analysis is to examine the dataset to identify the critical characteristics of listings that play a significant role in determining price, popularity, and overall success on Airbnb. We will analyze the data descriptively to gain a basic understanding, followed by inferential statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships. Based on this analysis, we will develop recommendations to help Airbnb and its hosts make more informed decisions regarding managing and promoting their listings.

Metric Evaluation:

To evaluate the success of this analysis, we will use metrics such as:

1. Accuracy in identifying the factors that influence price and popularity.
2. Relevance and applicability of recommendations in the Airbnb business context.
3. The potential impact of the recommendations on increasing revenue and customer satisfaction.
